# Project Ideas

- Create your own extension using any AWS service (or others). For example:
- Analytic dashboard using Elastic Search.
- Track you pet and trigger warning if it jumps on the sofa (using Polly).
- Using celebrity recognition in the face flow (using magazines or web search for images).
- Implement people counting system.
- Implement VIP gate or automatic garage door.
