   This will take you to to device screen, which shows the progress of your project deployment.

## View your project output

1. You need mplayer to view the project output from Deeplens device. For Windows, follow the installation instructions at this link: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html 
For Mac, install mplayer by using command below in the terminal window:

```
brew install mplayer
```

2. Wait until the project is deployed and you see the message Deployment of project Face-detection, version 0 succeeded. After project is successfully deployed, use the command below from terminal window to view project output stream:

```
ssh aws_cam@<IP Address of your deeplens device> cat /tmp/results.mjpeg | mplayer -demuxer lavf -lavfdopts format=mjpeg:probesize=32 -
```
Example:
```
ssh aws_cam@192.168.86.120 cat /tmp/results.mjpeg | mplayer -demuxer lavf -lavfdopts format=mjpeg:probesize=32 -
```

## Crop face and send to cloud

In this section you will update the lambda function that is part of face detection project to crop face and send it as IoT message. You will then create a rul in IoT to save that image to S3 if confidence level is above 50%.

1. Using your browser, open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions.
2. In the search box type deeplens-face-detection to find the lambda function for your project and click on the name of your lambda function.
3. Replace code in lambda function with code from [facecrop.py](facecrop.py) and click Save.
4. Click on Action and then Publish a new version.
5. Enter version description and click Publish.
6. Open the AWS DeepLens console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/deeplens/.
7. Choose Projects, then choose click on the project Face-detection.
8. On project details screen, click on Edit.
9. On Edit project screen, under Project content, click on Function to expand that section.

10. Under Version, select the current version that you just published.
11. Click Save. This will take you back to you project screen.

### Deploy updated project

Next you will deploy the Face Detection project you just updated.

1. From Deeplens console, On the Projects screen, choose the radio button to the left of your project name, then choose Deploy to device.

2. On the Target device screen, from the list of AWS DeepLens devices, choose the radio button to the left of the device that you want to deploy this project to. An AWS DeepLens device can have only one project deployed to it at a time.

3. Choose Review.

   This will take you to the Review and deploy screen.

   Since the project is already deployed to the device, you will see an error message
   "There is an existing project on this device. Do you want to replace it?
   If you Deploy, AWS DeepLens will remove the current project before deploying the new project."

4. On the Review and deploy screen, review your project and choose Deploy to deploy the project.

   This will take you to to device screen, which shows the progress of your project deployment. Wait until the project is deployed and you see the message Deployment of project Face-detection, version 1 succeeded. After project is successfully deployed.

### View face detection and cropped face output in IoT

1. Using your browser, open the AWS IoT console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/dashboard.
2. Click on Test and enter the subscription topic for your Deeplens device which is in the format "$aws/things/deeplens_c2422202-e22f-4220-a333-9456789154f5/infer"
3. Click on Subscribe to topic. That will take you the screen for topic where you can see all incoming messages.
4. As Deeplens detects a face, it will crop the face and send the image as a json message to IoT.

## Save Images from IoT messages to S3

In this section you will create resources including S3 bucket, Lambda function and IoT rule to invoke the lambda function with image data if confidence level is above 80%.

### Create S3 Bucket

_This is the bucket to which cropped faces coming from DeepLens will be stored._

1. Go to S3 in AWS Console at https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1.
2. Click "Create bucket", and enter the following details:
*	Bucket name: _[Your name or username]-dl-faces_
*	Region: US East (N. Virginia)
3.	Click "Create".

### Create an IAM Role

_This will allow our Lambda function (created in later steps) to access our S3 bucket, and other services that will be used in later parts of this workshop._

1. Go to IAM in AWS Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home
2.	On the left-hand side of the screen, click "Roles", and then click “Create Role”.

      - Click Create rule.

### Verify Deeplens is sending faces to S3
Go to S3 bucket _[Your name or username]-dl-faces_ and you should now see images coming from Deeplens.

## Completion
You have successfully created and deployed a face detection project on DeepLens. You also modified the default project so when DeepLens detects a human face, it will crop the face and store as image in S3. In the next activity, [Rekognition](../2-Rekognition), you will learn how Amazon Rekognition provides Deep learning-based image and video analysis capabilities including face verification in the cloud.
